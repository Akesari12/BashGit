# Git Challenge 1

1. Divide yourselves into groups of 3.

2. Have one person act as the "maintainer" and the other two act as "contributors" A and B. 

3. The maintainer creates a repository with a README.md file so that it can immediately be cloned. 

4. Maintainer adds contributors A and B as collaborators on the project (click "Settings" --> "Collaborators" --> "Add collaborator") 

5. The maintainer creates a file named animals.txt and adds their favorite animal to this file. 

6. Contributors A and B fork this repository and each add their favorite animals to this file. 

7. Contributors A and B then create a pull request (click the "pull request" button, then click it again) so the maintainer can see the proposed changes. 

8. Maintainer reviews changes and accepts the proposed changes. 

### Did it work!?

9. If conflicts, the issue is "resolved" as long as the headers <<<< ==== and >>>> are deleted. 

10. All people in each group should add an issue using the "Issues" tab. Did you each receive emails about the creation of these issues? 

11. Click the "commits" tab to see changes made by your group members.
